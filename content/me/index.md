Hi, I am a light artist based in Bielefeld, Germany. I create light installations, visuals, interactive art, mixed-media creations, and much much more. You can check them in the [exhibits](/exhibits) section.

I want my creations to come to life and be part of something larger by applying and integrating them into larger assemblies, (dance) floors, clubs, or exhibitions.

I work primarily at my artelier in the [Kulturhaus Bielefeld e.V.](https://kulturhaus-ostblock.de) and am open to collaborations and bookings - get in touch!

Always anti-facist **âš‘**
